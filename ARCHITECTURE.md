## Models Used

### Primary Model
- **Base Model**: GPT-4 (or GPT-3.5-turbo as fallback)
- **Fine-tuning Method**: LoRA (Low-Rank Adaptation)
- **Rank Configuration**: 16-32 for optimal balance
- **Training Data**: 10,000+ job application samples
- **Specialization**: Professional writing, form field understanding

### Supporting Models
- **Field Detection Model**: Custom CNN for form element recognition
- **Content Validation Model**: BERT-based classifier for quality assessment
- **Style Adaptation Model**: Fine-tuned for professional tone consistency

## Reasons for Architectural Choices

### LoRA Fine-tuning
- **Efficiency**: Only 0.5-1% of parameters updated, reducing computational requirements
- **Performance**: Maintains base model capabilities while adding domain specialization
- **Deployment**: Easier to deploy and update compared to full model fine-tuning
- **Cost**: Lower inference costs with specialized performance

### Multi-agent Architecture
- **Modularity**: Separate concerns for planning and execution
- **Scalability**: Easy to add new agents for specific tasks
- **Debugging**: Isolated error handling and performance monitoring
- **Flexibility**: Different strategies for different job types

### React + FastAPI Stack
- **Frontend**: Modern, responsive UI with excellent developer experience
- **Backend**: High-performance Python framework optimized for AI workloads
- **Integration**: Seamless API communication with WebSocket support
- **Ecosystem**: Rich libraries for both web development and AI/ML

### Browser Extension Integration
- **User Experience**: Seamless integration with existing workflows
- **Accessibility**: Works across different job application platforms
- **Privacy**: Client-side processing with user consent
- **Compatibility**: Standards-based implementation for broad browser support

## Data Flow Architecture

```
User Input → Frontend → API Gateway → AI Pipeline → Database → Response → Frontend → Browser Extension → Job Form
```

## Security Considerations
- **Data Privacy**: All user data encrypted and stored securely
- **API Security**: JWT authentication and rate limiting
- **Model Safety**: Content filtering and validation layers
- **Browser Security**: Extension permissions limited to necessary domains

## Performance Optimization
- **Model Caching**: Pre-loaded models for faster inference
- **Batch Processing**: Parallel content generation
- **Lazy Loading**: Components loaded on demand
- **CDN Integration**: Static assets served via CDN

## Future Enhancements
- **Multi-language Support**: Expand to non-English job markets
- **Advanced RAG**: Integration with more data sources
- **Real-time Collaboration**: Multi-user application support
- **Mobile App**: Native mobile application development
